Your struggle really resonated with me because I've been through something similar.\n\nI ended up creating Spend Slow as a way to manage impulse purchases. It works by letting you add items and then choosing a cooldown period before you can buy them. Sometimes just knowing you have to wait 3 or 7 days is enough to change your mind.\n\nThere's a free tier if you want to give it a try. Either way, I'm rooting for you!"
